summary: Newest App Release Gives Consumers Unprecedented Access to Dealers via Text Message

---
SANTA MONICA, Calif. - May 14, 2015 - Car-buying platform Edmunds.com today released an update to its acclaimed mobile app with a new feature that now makes it possible for shoppers to send text messages to car dealers with just a touch of a button. The innovation is the latest step in the growing trend of consumers drawn to "place messaging," which offers a convenient way to interact with businesses via text in the same way that they do with friends and family.

Unlike other place messaging solutions that only work in concert with apps such as Snapchat and WhatsApp, Edmunds' texting solution uses the phone's native texting platform. That means all smartphones are capable of messaging dealers without relying on any other apps.

"More and more shoppers are turning to text messaging for their customer service needs, but until now there wasn't a reliable way to text directly with car dealerships," said Edmunds.com President Seth Berkowitz. "Edmunds.com's app seamlessly integrates text messaging to thousands of dealers nationwide, so now consumers can text a sales or service inquiry and receive a timely, customized response from a dealership representative."

The new feature is a direct response to the 34 percent of car shoppers who told Edmunds that they would prefer text messaging with dealers instead of communicating by phone or e-mail. Users can also receive instant video and picture messages from dealerships for vehicles on the dealer's lot. And while other place messaging apps rely on third parties to answer questions or set appointments, Edmunds' app connects users with a live person at the dealership. In addition, users can opt out of a conversation at any time simply by typing "STOP."

Text messaging is just the latest of many useful car shopping features offered by the Edmunds app. The app allows shoppers to browse and identify inventory in their area, to get upfront price guarantees on cars in stock through Edmunds Price Promise, and to crunch numbers on an easy-to-use monthly payment calculator. The app also allows users to text directly with Edmunds Live Help, a free service that provides users with real-time access to Edmunds' roster of car buying experts who can answer any questions about the car-shopping process, such as whether they're getting a good deal or what sort of options are available on specific models. Shoppers can also connect with Live Help by calling 1-855-782-4711 or by texting ED411.
