Here at Edmunds we not only work really hard, but we play really hard, as well. 

We just so happen to have this neat little workplace "policy" called ROWE (Results Only Work Environment), where we get to work wherever we want, whenever we want - so long as we continue to excel on the job. It's just one of the many things that make Edmundsians love working here, aside from a few other small perks, such as its innovation-centric culture, its uber collaborative work environment, and its monthly massage & weekly meditation sessions, and did I mention its in-house movie & sporting event viewings and subsidized health & gym memberships? But don't take my word for it. Edmunds was recently featured by CyberCoders.com in Ritika Trikha's article, "5 Ways to Create a More Positive Culture".
