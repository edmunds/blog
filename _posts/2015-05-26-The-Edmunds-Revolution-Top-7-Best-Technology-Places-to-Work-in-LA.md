Built in LA recently published an article referencing Edmunds as one of the Top 7 Best Technology Places to Work in LA.  [7 Companies to Advance Your Career in Tech - That Are Hiring Right Now](http://www.builtinla.com/2015/04/29/7-companies-advance-your-career-tech-are-hiring-right-now/). While the article lists the extrinsic benefits, there's more to our company than the surface freebies. In an internal discussion about this article, our own Julie Merges,Chief People Officer, states it best.

> Edmunds is known for caring about its people and I'm proud to work for a company that keeps its employees front and center. We have one of the most innovative and progressive cultures that pushes itself to transform our industry, not take incremental steps. We are set apart from other tech organizations because we are not only progressive, but we have a culture that empowers its people to be treated as adults and be held accountable for results. Each of these things are hard to replicate in a meaningful way at another company. Each of these things makes us uniquely Edmunds.
