This is where you put the actual text for the blog post.

Here's a template table:

| Things I like to Eat | Reasons Why |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Frozen Peas | I love frozen peas because they are refreshing and cold.  What a great summer snack! |
| Fish Sticks are great too| I mean... they go well with frozen peas |
| Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwiches and other types of sandwiches | Who doesn't like sandwiches|
| Frozen Peas | I mean come on.  Who doesn't like them?  Most people maybe... |

Here's an example of a numbered list.

1. Proactive - take ownership of your own work
2. An adult - gives you responsibility and holds you accountable
3. Communicative - requires you to actually talk to your teammates
